<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p> We plan on counting and analyzing the customers in a restaurant. The program will gather data on the fullness of the restaurant, which tables are preferred by customers, age and gender analysis of the customers etc. through the camera feed. This data will be used by the restaurant owners to optimize their restaurants and give promotions or rearrange prices to increase their profits and customer experiences. </p>
