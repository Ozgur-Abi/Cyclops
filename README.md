<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p> We plan on counting and analyzing the customers in a restourant. The program will gather data on the fullness of the restourant, which tables are preferred by customers, age and gender analysis of the customers etc. through the camera feed. This data will be used by the restourant owners to optimize their restourants and give promotions or rearrange prices to increase their profits and customer experiences. </p>
